Government databases store sensitive and valuable data that affects the public interest and trust, such as citizen records, land registries, health records, tax records, etc. However, because of the complexity of document verification in most countries, it enabled criminals to use forged documents. And ever since the emergence of blockchain technology verification of information has become simpler. This thesis is motivated to ease the process of document verification for government issued documents by implementing blockchain technology.
After a close examination of blockchain implementation by multiple countries, some issues were observed. This thesis addresses these issues by building a system and evaluating that system based on the perceived issues. The first objective of this thesis is to design a system that deals with such problems and the second objective is to evaluate it based on a certain criteria. The system was built to demonstrate blockchain ability for document verification of selected government issued documents. These documents were selected across multiple countries and government sectors using stratified, convenience and purposive sampling methods. After these documents were collected they were analyzed using a deductive approach. 
After some iterations the final system was developed and it shows the advantages of using one centralized blockchain to retain records of documents across multiple government sectors and by connecting every document with its proof of documents eliminates unverifiable documents. Meaning someone's passport token on the blockchain will be linked to their birth certificate token, and their birth certificate token will be linked to the parent’s identity token there by ensuring every  document’s connection with its proof of document.
